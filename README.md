# Overview
Hospital readmissions represent a significant challenge in the healthcare sector, both as an indicator of care quality and a driver of escalating costs. When a patient is re-admitted to the hospital within a short period after discharge, it not only indicates potential gaps in care but also adds to the financial burden on the healthcare system. In particular, readmissions of diabetic patients have been noted to contribute significantly to these costs. Therefore, being able to predict such readmissions can lead to improved patient care and substantial cost savings.
