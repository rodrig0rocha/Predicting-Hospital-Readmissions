# Overview
Hospital readmissions represent a significant challenge in the healthcaresector, both as an indicator of care quality and a driver of escalating costs.When a patient is re-admitted to the hospital within a short period afterdischarge, it not only indicates potential gaps in care but also adds to thefinancial burden on the healthcare system. In particular, readmissions ofdiabetic patients have been noted to contribute significantly to thesecosts. Therefore, being able to predict such readmissions can lead toimproved patient care and substantial cost savings.
